            <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
            <p>The fashion industry contributes a large percentage of 
                carbon emissions to our environment. Sustainability in the fashion 
                industry is the need of the hour and is now a choice for many. The 
                increase in awareness and demand for sustainable and durable 
                clothing is why many new sustainable brands are coming into being 
                and why more well-established big brands are making noticeable 
                efforts to adopt sustainable practices.
                Although generation Z is the one giving most business to the fashion 
                industry, they are more aware of their choices. People now want to 
                know what they are buying; they are going in-depth to know what 
                practices their choice of brands are engaging in. Gen Z seems to want 
                to invest in sustainable brands more than ever. According to research 
                in 2021, 59% of people are willing to pay 10% more for sustainable 
                products.<br>
                Eco Wear is of the brands leading the way to sustainability practices in 
                manufacturing and supply chains. It became the first brand to switch 
                to using only organically grown cotton in 1996, and since then, there 
                has been no looking back for the brand as it strives towards zero 
                emissions.<br>
                The brand also became successful in initiating and helping to create a 
                Sustainable Apparel Coalition with 49 members at present comprising 
                top leaders in the apparel industry, non-governmental organizations, 
                academia. The coalition is aiming for a clothing industry that does no 
                harm to the environment and positively affects the people associated 
                with it. <br><br> Eco Wear Sustainability <br><br>
                Eco Wear ticks many boxes of being a sustainable brand. It is not just a 
                brand leading in outdoor apparel but is out there 
                supporting sustainability in fashion by providing some provisions that 
                can second that.<br><br>
                Provisions by the Brand<br><br>
                • 85% of clothes end up in landfills, and the cleaning and disposal 
                of garments in these landfills increase the environmental impact. 
                Eco Wear encourages buying less. It runs "Worn Wear," a 
                program that promotes reuse. It allows its customers to trade in 
                their old Eco Wear products and buy used clothing.<br>
                • Eco Wear offers repair, replacement, or refunds for apparel if it 
                does not satisfy the customer, or they detect a problem with it. 
                The brand also offers to repair damage due to wear and tear at a 
                reasonable charge.<br>
                • Eco Wear allows its employees to dedicate up to two months of 
                fully paid time to the environment.<br>
                • One percent of the earth tax is another way of giving to the 
                environment. Eco Wear gives one percent of its sales every year 
                to help increase more sustainable practices in the apparel 
                industry.<br>
                • Eco Wear as a brand is quite transparent with its practices. The 
                brand is not hesitant to show its customers the materials and 
                techniques used to make its clothing, but it is out there with its 
                marketing. Instead of the conventional marketing method, Eco 
                Wear uses activism for its advertisements. A famous example of 
                this is their "don’t buy this jacket" campaign.</p>
